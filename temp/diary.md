The Travancore Club traces its origins to a group of individuals with shared interests in cultural,
sports, literary, and social gatherings. These like-minded individuals used to meet at Pandanpadavil,
the residence of Dr. George Varghese. In one such meeting in the early 90's, the idea of forming a club
in Thiruvalla was conceived. To bring this vision to life, an ad-hoc committee was formed, comprising
Mr. Jacob Cherian, Mr. Jacob Kattasseril, and Dr. A.C. Rajeev Kumar. and Mr. PD George. At a
subsequent meeting convened by the committee at Hotel Italia, 75 individuals paid a non-refundable
registration fee, marking the club's formal inception. The club began its operations on August 17, 1994
(Chingam 1, Malayalam calendar), in a rented building near Chakrakshala Kadavu in Kizhakkummuti.
The Travancore Club is a testament to its legendary founding members’ farsightedness and unwavering
dedication. These visionaries, driven by a shared dream of creating a vibrant hub for cultural, social,
and recreational pursuits, laid the foundation for what the club represents today. Through the tireless
determination of the legends, the members successfully constructed a permanent clubhouse extending
a land of 6.5 acres by the side of MC Road (now a State Highway). The clubhouse was inaugurated
by Princess Aswathy Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, a proud milestone in the club’s history. Today, the
Travancore Club features a membership of over 1,000 and offers an array of facilities, including:

A spacious auditorium, Shuttle court and Tennis court, Card room, Gymnasium, A serene walkway along
a pond, A well-appointed guest house, a Music hall, a Restaurant, and a permit room for members. The
Club undertakes various projects in collaboration with state and central government agencies. Driven
by a sense of social responsibility, its generous members frequently extend help to those in need during
times of crisis. The Club also organizes competitions catering to youth, children, and elderly citizens,
